## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a [Starbucks Menu dataset found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/starbucks-menu) containing approximately 113 food menu and 242 beverage menu, here's list of question to help me obtain some information for better understanding:

 - What is the nutrition facts of each Starbucksâ€™ menu?
 - Is caffeine on a coffee affect calories?
 - How nutrition facts correlate with each other?

I keen to explore the data and then share some insightful information to public audience via a blog post on Medium

## File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook available here named articles_starbucks_nutritional_content.ipynb to showcase my work related to the questions posed. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

## Medium Blog Post
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@krianbayuadhinata/this-data-will-help-people-on-a-diet-to-choose-the-right-menu-at-starbucks-c6ea845b1fd8)
